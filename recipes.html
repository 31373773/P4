        <h1><u>Nadiya Hussain's apple palm pies</u></h1>
          <img src='images/apple_palm_pies_70419_16x9.jpg' alt="apple palm pies" width=40% height=40%>
            <br><b>INGREDIENTS</b>
            <br>2 x 285g/10oz jars chunky apple sauce
            <br>½ tsp ground mixed spice
            <br>50g/1¾oz mixed nuts, roughly chopped
            <br>50g/1¾oz raisins
            <br>cooking oil spray
            <br>270g/9¾oz pack filo pastry, or 6 sheets
            <br>demerara sugar, for sprinkling
            <br>ice cream or custard, to serve (optional)
            <br><b>METHOD</b>
            <br>Put the apple sauce, mixed spice, nuts and raisins into a bowl, stir well and set aside.
            <br>Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6. Have a 12-hole muffin tray at the ready and spray the inside of each hole liberally with oil.
            <br>Unroll the filo pastry onto a work surface. Using kitchen scissors, cut out all the pastry in one go to make eight equal squares per sheet, totalling 48 squares. Keep the squares you’re not working with under a tea towel to prevent them drying out.
            <br>Take one square of filo and spray it with oil, lay another square on top, spray again, then lay another on top and spray again. You should have three squares oiled together. It doesn’t matter if the squares are a bit off-centre.
            <br>Place inside the oiled cavity of the muffin tray, press down, and repeat this process until you have filled all 12 holes in the muffin tray.
            <br>Fill each hole with an equal amount of the apple filling.
            <br>Take another square of filo and spray well, then fold in half and in half again to create a small square. Place the small square on top of the apple mixture and fold the pointy edges inwards. If any areas feel dry, spray with oil. Repeat for all 12, then sprinkle with sugar and bake for 14–16 minutes.
            <br>Leave to cool in the tin for 10 minutes.
            <br>These are best eaten warm, with ice cream or custard.
          
          
        <h1><u>Nadiya Hussain's gingerbread cookies</u></h1>
          <img src='images/gingerbread.jpg' alt="gingerbread cookies" width=40% height=40%>
            <br><b>INGREDIENTS</b>
            <br>350g/12oz plain flour, plus extra for rolling out
            <br>1 tsp bicarbonate of soda
            <br>2 tsp ground ginger
            <br>1 tsp ground cinnamon
            <br>125g/4½oz butter
            <br>175g/6oz light soft brown sugar
            <br>1 free-range egg
            <br>4 tbsp golden syrup
            <br>To decorate:
            <br>writing icing
            <br>cake decorations
            <br><b>METHOD</b>
            <br>Sift together the flour, bicarbonate of soda, ginger and cinnamon and pour into the bowl of a food processor. Add the butter and blend until the mix looks like breadcrumbs. Stir in the sugar.
            <br>Lightly beat the egg and golden syrup together, add to the food processor and pulse until the mixture clumps together. Tip the dough out, knead briefly until smooth, wrap in clingfim and leave to chill in the fridge for 15 minutes.
            <br>Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4. Line two baking trays with greaseproof paper.
            <br>Roll the dough out to a 0.5cm/¼in thickness on a lightly floured surface. Using cutters, cut out the gingerbread men shapes and place on the baking tray, leaving a gap between them. For decorations, use a skewer to make a small hole in the top of each biscuit.
            <br>Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until lightly golden-brown. Leave on the tray for 10 minutes and then move to a wire rack to finish cooling. When cooled decorate with the writing icing and cake decorations.

          <img src='images/flies.jpg' alt="butterfly cakes"width=40% height=40%>
            <br><b>INGREDIENTS</b>
            <br>For the cake:
            <br>100g/3½oz baking spread
            <br>100g/3½oz caster sugar
            <br>2 large free-range eggs
            <br>100g/3½oz self-raising flour
            <br>1 level tsp baking powder
            <br>1 orange, grated zest only
            <br>For the filling:
            <br>3 tbsp orange curd
            <br>For the icing: 
            <br>50g/1¾oz soft butter
            <br>100g/3½oz sifted icing sugar
            <br>To finish: 
            <br>icing sugar, to dust

            <br><b>METHOD</b>
            <br>Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4.
            <br>Put all the cake ingredients into a large bowl and beat well for 2-3 minutes, or until the mixture is well-blended and smooth. Fill each paper case with about 35g/1¼oz of mixture.
            <br>Bake in the preheated oven for about 15-20 minutes, or until the cakes are well risen and golden-brown. Lift the paper cases out of the bun tin and cool the cakes on a wire rack.
            <br>When cool, cut a disc from the top of each cake leaving a little gap around the edge and cut this slice in half. Spoon half a teaspoonful of orange curd in each.
            <br>To make the icing, beat the butter and icing sugar together until well blended. Pipe or spoon a swirl of buttercream on top of the orange curd and place the half slices of cake on top to resemble butterfly wings. Dust the cakes with icing sugar to finish.
