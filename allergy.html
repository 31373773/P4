            <h3><u>Allergy Awesomeness's Chocolate Cupcakes (GLUTEN, DAIRY, EGG, PEANUT & TREE NUT FREE; VEGAN)</u></h3>
          <img src='images/cupc.jpg' alt="choc cupcakes" width=40% height=40%>
            <br><b>INGREDIENTS</b>
            <br>1 cup water 
            <br>1 and 1/2 sticks vegan butter (12 Tablespoons)
            <br>1/3 cup cocoa powder
            <br>1 teaspoon salt
            <br>2 cups of my gluten-free flour
            <br>1 and 1/2 cups granulated sugar
            <br>1 teaspoon baking soda
            <br>3/4 teaspoon xanthan
            <br>2 flax eggs (2 Tablespoons ground flax seeds mixed with 5 Tablespoons of water)
            <br>1 teaspoon vanilla extract
            <br>Vegan chocolate buttercream (optional)
            <br>1/2 cup applesauce or dairy free sour-cream (see above)
            <br><b>METHOD</b>
            <br>Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F. Generously grease your pan with non-stick cooking spray, (if doing a 13x9). Or, line your cupcake tin with cupcake liners (makes 12).
            <br>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the cake’s dry ingredients.In a saucepan over medium-low heat, melt your vegan butter. Add your water, cocoa powder, and dairy-free sour cream/applesauce and stir to incorporate. Take off the heat and add your flax eggs, vanilla, and then whisk in your dry ingredients. Stir until smooth.
            <br>Pour the batter into your pan or cupcake tin. Bake at 350 for 15-20 minutes for cupcakes, and 20-25 minutes for the cake. Or, until the middle of the cake springs back when you touch it, and it's slightly pulling away from the edges.
            <br>Allow the cake to cool. While it's cooling, make the frosting. Spread or pipe the frosting onto the cooled cake. Keep covered at room temperature, to keep the frosting from drying out.

        <h1><u>Lisa Leake's Chocolate Rainbow Bites (EGG-FREE, DAIRY-FREE, NUT-FREE, GLUTEN-FREE, PEANUT/TREE-NUT FREE, VEGETARIAN)</u></h1>
          <img src='images/Paleo-Rainbow-Bites.jpg'width=40% height=40% alt="paleo raibow bites">
            <br><b>INGREDIENTS</b>
            <br>1 bag dark chocolate morsels, Enjoy Life Foods
            <br>dried fruit, assorted
            <br>seeds, assorted
            <br><b>METHOD</b>
            <br>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
            <br>Melt the chocolate in a small pot over very low heat while stirring constantly. Alternatively, you can place the chocolate in a microwave-safe glass measuring cup. Microwave for 60 seconds and then stir. Microwave for another 30 seconds, and then stir again to completely melt the chocolate.
            <br>Use a spoon to make small rounds of chocolate on the parchment paper. Let the chocolate fall from the spoon and it will naturally form a round shape. Immediately sprinkle the top of each chocolate round with an assortment of diced dried fruits and seeds while the chocolate is still hot.
            <br>Put the baking sheet in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour until the Rainbow Bites are firm. Then serve and enjoy!
          
          
        <h1><u>Netsle's chocolate chip cookies (GLUTEN-FREE)</u></h1>
          <img src='images/cks.jpg' alt="vgf choc chip cookies" width=40% height=40%>
            <br><b>INGREDIENTS</b>
            <br>1 1/2 cups gluten-free 1:1 baking flour blend (we recommend King Arthur Flour)
            <br>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
            <br>1/2 teaspoon baking soda
            <br>1/2 teaspoon baking powder
            <br>1/2 cup vegetable shortening (palm)
            <br>1/2 cup packed brown sugar
            <br>1/2 cup granulated sugar
            <br>1/3 cup water, room temperature
            <br>1 to 2 Tablespoons vanilla extract
            <br>1 2/3 cups (10-oz. pkg.) Simply Delicious Semi-Sweet Chocolate Morsels by NESTLÉ® TOLL HOUSE®
            <br><b>METHOD</b>
            <br>Preheat oven to 350° F. Line baking sheets with parchment paper.
            <br>Combine flour, salt, baking soda and baking powder in small bowl. Beat shortening, brown sugar and granulated sugar in large mixer bowl until blended. Mixture will look sandy. Add water and vanilla extract; mix well. Gradually beat in flour mixture. Stir in morsels. Drop by rounded tablespoon onto prepared baking sheets. 
            <br>Flatter each dollop to a rounded shape.
            <br>Roll the dough out to a 0.5cm/¼in thickness on a lightly floured surface. Using cutters, cut out the gingerbread men shapes and place on the baking tray, leaving a gap between them. For decorations, use a skewer to make a small hole in the top of each biscuit. Then bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until tan across cookie surface. Cool on baking sheets for 10 minutes; remove to wire racks to cool completely. Store in airtight container. Makes about 36 cookies
          
          
        <h1><u>Lindsay Dietz's Ooey Gooey Allergy-Friendly Brownies (GRAIN-FREE, GLUTEN-FREE, NUT-FREE, DAIRY-FREE, EGG-FREE, BEAN-FREE) </u></h1>
          <img src='images/main-4.jpg' alt="allergy brownies" width=40% height=40%>
            <br><b>INGREDIENTS</b>
            <br>2 tablespoons ground chia seeds
            <br>6 tablespoons warm filtered water
            <br>1/2 cup coconut oil
            <br>3/4 cup maple syrup
            <br>1/2 cup fermented raw cacao powder
            <br>1/2 cup cassava flour 
            <br>1 tablespoon coconut flour - use 2 tablespoons more cassava flour if sensitive to coconut
            <br>2 teaspoons vanilla extract
            <br>1/4 teaspoon salt
            <br>1/4 teaspoon grain-free baking powder

            <br><b>METHOD</b>
            <br>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Grease an 8" x 8" glass baking dish.
            <br>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together ground chia seeds and water.Whisk in the remaining ingredients, in the order listed, until smooth. Pour into the greased baking dish.
            <br>Bake in the preheated oven for about 15-20 minutes, or until the cakes are well risen and golden-brown. Lift the paper cases out of the bun tin and cool the cakes on a wire rack.
            <br>Bake 30 to 35 minutes. Cool completely before slicing and eating. I think these brownies are best after sitting overnight!
          
        <h1><u>Nora Cook's Vegan Cake (EGG_FREE, VEGAN)</u></h1>
            <img src='images/nora.jpg'alt="vegan choc cake"width=40% height=40%>
            <br><b>INGREDIENTS</b>
            <br>For the cake:
            <br>1 cup unsweetened almond milk
            <br>1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
            <br>2 cups all purpose flour
            <br>1 3/4 cups granulated sugar
            <br>3/4 cup cocoa powder
            <br>2 teaspoons baking powder
            <br> 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
            <br>1 teaspoon salt
            <br>1/2 cup canola oil OR melted coconut oil
            <br>2/3 cup unsweetened applesauce
            <br>1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract
            <br>1 cup boiling water
            <br>Chocolate Buttercream Frosting: 
            <br>1 cup cocoa powder
            <br>4-5 cups powdered sugar
            <br>1 1/2 cups earth balance vegan butter, softened baking sticks preferred
            <br>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
            <br>1/4-1/2 cup unsweetened almond milk
            <br><b>CAKE</b>
            <br>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F and grease two 9-inch cake pans. I also line them with parchment rounds and lightly flour for easy removal of the cakes later.
            <br>Measure 1 cup unsweetened almond milk and add the tablespoon of vinegar to it. Stir slightly and set aside to curdle.
            <br>In a large bowl, add the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Whisk well to combine.
            <br>Now add the oil, applesauce, vanilla and almond milk/vinegar mixture. Mix on medium speed with a hand mixer (or stand mixer with the paddle attachment) until well combined. 
            <br>Lower the speed and carefully pour in the boiling water, continuing to mix into the cake batter until combined. The batter will seem very runny at this point; that is how it should be, trust me! Divide the batter evenly between your cake pans. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. After 10 minutes of cooling in the pan, carefully remove the cakes from the pans and let cool completely before frosting.
            <br><b>BUTTERCREAM</b>
            <br>Add the cocoa powder to a large bowl (I just wipe out the cake bowl and use it for the frosting). Whisk well to remove any clumps.
            <br>Add the softened vegan butter and mix with a hand mixer until creamed and well combined.
            <br>Add half of the powdered sugar and half of the almond milk, and mix until combined. Add the rest of the powdered sugar and vanilla extract. Mix starting on low, and turn to high. Mix until fluffy and combined.
            <br>If the frosting seems too dry, add more milk, a tablespoon or two at a time. If the frosting seems too wet and doesn't hold it's shape, add more powdered sugar until it thickens up. 
            <br>Frost the cake using an icing spatula or just a butter knife.
